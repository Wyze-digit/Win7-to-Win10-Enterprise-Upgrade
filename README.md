# Win7-to-Win10-Enterprise-Upgrade Project
Step-by-step checklist and documentation for upgrading enterprise client computer systems from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise, based on real IT support work experience at Access Bank Plc. 

üìå Project Overview
This repository documents the Windows 7 to Windows 10 Enterprise client upgrade project carried out in a large-scale financial institution (Access Bank).
The upgrade was done in a domain-based, client‚Äìserver environment with strict IT governance (Active Directory, GPO policies, and cross-team collaboration). The project demonstrates how IT Support coordinates enterprise OS upgrades, handles first-line troubleshooting, and collaborates with Networks, Security, and Cloud Engineering teams to ensure smooth migration.

As an IT Technical Support Officer, I was directly responsible for:
- Performing **pre-upgrade checks** (hardware validation - Verifying hardware health (HDD, RAM), user data review - Backup User data on temporary storage, compliance - Ensuring compliance with naming standards & upgrade readiness.)  
- Executed **upgrade installation** physically at user systems: Physically performing clean installs using prepared bootable USB.
- Conducted **post-upgrade troubleshooting** including: - Reinstalling/configuring business applications. - Applying upgrade checklist during manual PC-by-PC installations. - Driver issues. - Application reinstallation & configuration. - DHCP assignment verification. - Host renaming (per naming standards from Cloud Engineering). - Domain join (with admin credentials after Security validation). - Validating DHCP and network assignments (escalating IP issues to Networks Team). - Completed documentation and reported via official **upgrade template** to the IT Support Team Lead, IT Technical Support Representatives
