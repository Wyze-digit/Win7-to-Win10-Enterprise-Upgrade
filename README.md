# Win7-to-Win10-Enterprise-Upgrade Project
Step-by-step checklist and documentation for upgrading enterprise client computer systems from Windows 7 Enterprise to Windows 10 Enterprise, based on real IT support work experience at Access Bank Plc. 

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository documents the Windows 7 to Windows 10 Enterprise client upgrade project carried out in a large-scale financial institution (Access Bank).
The upgrade was done in a domain-based, clientâ€“server environment with strict IT governance (Active Directory, GPO policies, and cross-team collaboration).

The project demonstrates how IT Support coordinates enterprise OS upgrades, handles first-line troubleshooting, and collaborates with Networks, Security, and Cloud Engineering teams to ensure smooth migration.
